                <h1>About Cosplay</h1>
                <p>The word cosplay comes from a combination of the words costume play and refers to the performance of art of imitating
                    a character through costumes, these people are called cosplayers. The inspiration for these costumes comes from  the
                    media with sources being manga and anime, comic book and cartoons, video games, and film and television.
                    <br> The rapid growth of cosplay is partly due to the tight knit subculture that envolops it, since 1990 this
                    significant aspect of pop culture has spread from Japan and Asia to the Western world. Cosplay events are a common
                    way for cosplayers to meet and show of thier costumes, there are many social networks, local and international
                    competitions centered around cosplay.
